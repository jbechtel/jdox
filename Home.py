"# ðŸ”­JDox Chatbot with LLamaIndex and Streamlit"

"""This project allows users to interact with the James Webb Space Telescope documentation (JDox) 
    with natural language. See JDox here [https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/)"""

"""
Currently, there are two tools available on the left side bar:

- **JDox Chatbot**: combines Chat-GPT and a vector index to help users answer questions with JDox.  
    Since it uses Chat-GPT, an OpenAI key is required. Enter it on the sidebar to use this tool. 

- **Index Retriever**: queries JDox with just the vector index and without an LLM. 
    Therefore, it doesn't require an API key.
